        <p>
          I began my post-college career as a front-end developer at Cognizant, a technology consulting company.
          As an associate at Cognizant, I am deployable directly into live projects with world class customers.

        <p>
          For the first three months, I was immersed in a Digital Experience ReactJS &amp; UI Engineering
          training program. This program allowed me to refine my skills in <span className="skill">React </span>
          and pick up new skills in <span className="skill">TypeScript</span> and <span className="skill">AWS</span>.
          I developed a full-stack ecommerce web application (Plantome) as the culminating project for the first part
          of the training program. Following the presentation of this project, I participated in another enablement
          program that focused on an <span className="skill">Agile</span> development and working with clients/stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am in a full-stack training program in preparation for deployment to a large client. In this program,
          I am working on improving my skills in <span className="skill">Java</span> and the <span className="skill">SpringBoot </span>
          framework.
