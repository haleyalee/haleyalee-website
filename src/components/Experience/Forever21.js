          I first developed a love for design while working part-time at Forever 21 the summer of 2018. Fashion had always been an
          interest of mine, and so I took the opportunity to immerse myself within it this summer. As a visual design associate, I was 
          responsible for curating the product displays: every table, rack, and wall was carefully constructed to display the clothing in 
          the most visually captivating way. Funnily enough, from this job, I learned the importance of <span className="skill">user-centered design</span>. 
          Rather than creating outfits that suited my personal style, I had to consider what the current fashion trends were, as well 
          as what products were the most popular.

          I became incredibly disciplined this summer, as my workdays were from 6am to 2pm. Because the store opened mid-shift, I would also have
          to take on the role of sales associate. Through this, I was able to develop my customer service skills, which include patience, good
          communication, and efficiency.
